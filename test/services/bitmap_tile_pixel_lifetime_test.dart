/// A tile's pixels live in NATIVE memory freed by a [NativeFinalizer], so
/// every read of those bytes has to keep the TILE reachable — that is what
/// `BitmapTile.readPixels` is for, and why no raw pointer getter exists.
///
/// Pulling the pointer (or an `asTypedList` view of it) into a local does
/// NOT keep the tile alive. When the pre-blend staged a base rect through
/// such a view, a base tile could be collected mid-copy: its finalizer
/// returned the block to the C tile pool, the pool handed it to the next
/// allocation, and the copy then wrote through a pointer someone else
/// owned — an access violation that took the whole test process down.
///
/// This drives the shape that reproduced it every time: a Dart-engine
/// phase (which builds up collectable tiles) followed by a native-engine
/// phase that pre-blends, promotes and commits hard enough to make the GC
/// run mid-copy. It is a crash test — reaching the end IS the assertion.
