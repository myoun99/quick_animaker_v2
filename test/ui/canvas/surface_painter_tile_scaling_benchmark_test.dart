/// CANVAS lightening probe — the COLLECT pass's cost ceiling.
///
/// The painter now DRAWS only the tile coordinates the view covers
/// (O(visible), pinned by the "off-screen committed tile is not drawn"
/// test in bitmap_surface_painter_test.dart). What still walks the whole
/// cel is the DECODE-START collect pass: an Expando lookup per committed
/// tile, kept whole so off-screen tiles pre-warm in the background and
/// scroll in already decoded.
///
/// This times that collect walk at its WORST — no cache images, so every
/// tile answers needsDecodeStart and gets appended. It is the ceiling: in
/// production most committed tiles are already decoded, so the lookup
/// returns false and nothing is appended. Before the draw path was made
/// visible-only this walk ALSO issued a drawImage per tile and cost
/// ~2.2ms at 1024 tiles; the collect-only walk is ~0.1ms there. The
/// number to watch is that the collect walk stays cheap — if it ever
/// creeps back toward milliseconds, the pre-warm is too eager.
///
/// Prints; ratios within a run only.
