/// Folder CREATION mirroring over 겸용 (linked) cuts: making a folder
/// around a set of layers makes the same folder around their counterparts,
/// because folder existence and membership are shared structure.

/// Everything AFTER creation rides the ordinary layer machinery: the folder
/// row is a layer, so its eye/opacity/blend/name mirror through its own
/// link-registry group and its FX lanes and twirl stay per-use ("레인만
/// 각자, 나머지는 하나"). No folder-specific mirror table survives.

/// The OTHER cuts where [memberLayerIds]'s new folder must also appear,
/// with each member resolved to its linked counterpart there. A cut
/// qualifies only when EVERY member has a counterpart in it (겸용 cuts
/// always do — partial matches mean the structure diverged, so we stand
/// down rather than guess).
