/// raster carries the selection through the pre-blend kernel instead
/// (`BrushLiveStrokeRasterizer.selectionRegion`), so its promoted tiles
/// arrive already masked and the panel passes them straight through.
/// What still comes here: programmatic strokes and history redos, which
/// had no live raster to be masked in. Same mask bytes, same rounding,
/// same rule — so a redo cannot land a different edge than the stroke it
/// replays, at any mask softness.
///
/// Straight-alpha buffers make this exact for every brush blend mode at
/// once: alpha 0 is the documented "destination survives untouched" input
/// of the commit kernels — plain srcOver contributes nothing, the erase
/// stamp removes nothing, and the separable/behind kernels return the
/// destination bytes verbatim. So ONE mask on the stroke buffer clips
/// drawing, erasing and filling alike, with no per-mode special cases.
///
/// Returns null when nothing survives — the caller then skips the commit
/// entirely rather than landing an empty edit.
