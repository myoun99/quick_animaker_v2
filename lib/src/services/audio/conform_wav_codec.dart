/// The conformed-audio container (audio program 2B).
///
/// A conform is what a professional tool makes when you import compressed
/// audio: the file decoded once, at the project's sample rate, as plain
/// PCM. Pro Tools converts MP3/AAC on import outright; Premiere writes a
/// `.cfa` and plays from that. Nobody decodes a compressed frame inside the
/// audio callback, because a variable-length codec cannot promise to finish
/// in time and the callback cannot wait.
///
/// This writes a STANDARD WAV rather than a private format, on purpose:
/// any audio tool can open it, which makes a suspect conform something you
/// can listen to instead of something you have to reason about.
///
/// The source fingerprint rides in a custom `qacf` RIFF chunk. RIFF readers
/// skip chunks they do not know, so the file stays ordinary — and the
/// conform carries its own provenance instead of needing a second file
/// beside it that could go missing on its own.
///
/// Both directions run OFF the realtime thread — conforming happens at
/// import, loading happens when the timeline opens. Nothing here is
/// reachable from the audio callback.
