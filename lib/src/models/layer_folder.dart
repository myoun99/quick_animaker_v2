/// (user, 2026-07-23). It carries the eye, static opacity, blend mode and
/// FX lanes every layer carries; what it does not carry is cels. Membership
/// is the members' [Layer.folderId] pointer into the folder layer's id, so
/// the stack list keeps being the single truth of render/timeline order and
/// nesting never has to be re-derived from order alone.
///
/// Structural invariants (kept by the commands, checked by
/// [folderStructureProblem]):
/// - A folder's members occupy a CONTIGUOUS run of the stack and the folder
///   row sits DIRECTLY ABOVE it (at `lastMemberIndex + 1`) — so a
///   bottom-to-top walk has already seen every member when it reaches the
///   folder, which is exactly what the group buffer needs.
/// - Attach groups never split across a folder boundary.
/// - Nesting is allowed; cycles are not.
