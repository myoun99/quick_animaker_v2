/// The `qa_engine` binary's ABI contract: **one version number, one
/// loader, one place to change either.**
///
/// The C exports a single `qa_engine_abi_version()` for the whole library,
/// so Dart holding two expectations of it was never two facts — across the
/// nine bumps from v16 to v24 the two copies never once differed. What the
/// duplication actually bought was a way to forget one, which is what
/// happened when a bump missed the audio copy and took thirteen parity
/// suites down with it (R26).
///
/// Loaders still live apart, and should: the mixer runs on the device's
/// realtime thread, the raster engine on the UI isolate's workers, and
/// they stand down independently. That is a reason for separate
/// *instances*, not for separate copies of "which file, and which
/// version".
///
/// ## Bumping the ABI
///
/// 1. `qa_engine_abi_version()` in `packages/qa_native/src/qa_engine.c`,
///    with a `// vNN:` line saying what moved.
/// 2. [kQaEngineAbiVersion] below, plus a changelog entry here.
/// 3. Rebuild the standalone test binary:
///    `cmake -S packages/qa_native/src -B build/native_standalone &&
///    cmake --build build/native_standalone --config Release`
///
/// There is no third Dart constant to remember — `qa_engine_abi_test.dart`
/// fails if step 1 and step 2 disagree, and it needs no binary to say so.
///
/// Raising the number breaks nothing by itself: it is a gate, and layout
/// changes are caught separately by the `qa_*_sizeof` cross-checks. App
/// builds recompile the C every time, so only the standalone test binary
/// can go stale — and then the parity suites fail loudly under
/// `QA_REQUIRE_NATIVE=1` rather than skipping.
///
/// `qa_tablet` is a DIFFERENT binary with its own `qat_abi_version`; none
/// of this covers it.
///
/// ## Changelog
///
/// - v12: fill raster RGB -> RGBX (R22-D flood SIMD).
/// - v13: `qa_flood_fill_wave` — wave-parallel flood (R22-E3).
/// - v14: `qa_fill_compose_batch` — pooled fill compose (R25-③).
/// - v15: `qa_grid_raster_tile` — timeline grid tile rasterizer (UI-R18).
/// - v16: `qa_audio_mix` + output stage — the audio mixer core (2B).
/// - v17: `qa_audio_resample` — the polyphase resampler (2B).
/// - v18: AUDIO-PRO R1 — pan factors, fade curves and volume envelopes in
///   the clip struct, plus the shared envelope key array.
/// - v19: AUDIO-PRO R5 — `qa_audio_capture_*` (the guide-voice recorder).
/// - v20: AUDIO-PRO R7 — `qa_video_export_*` (the OS video encoder).
/// - v21: EX4 — `qa_video_export_open` gains container/codec/alpha/
///   bitrate, `qa_video_export_probe`, and `qa_image_encode_jpg` (stb).
/// - v22: BB-N1 — the stroke-blend tile kernel and the alpha-bounds scan.
/// - v23: `qa_audio_denoise_f32` — RNNoise voice-take suppression.
/// - v24: the fused pre-blend — `qa_tile_span` gained base/stroke/mask/
///   premul fields and `qa_pre_blend_tiles` stages, blends and
///   premultiplies a whole frame's overlay tiles in one pooled call. The
///   mask field carries the selection, so "draw inside the selection
///   only" happens in the kernel instead of a painter clip.

/// The version gate lives INSIDE the open on purpose: a loader that

/// platform defaults rather than failing, so pointing at a stale path
/// degrades to "no engine" instead of hiding a working one.
///
/// Absence is graceful everywhere this is called: every caller keeps a
/// Dart reference, a platform fallback, or an honest stand-down.
