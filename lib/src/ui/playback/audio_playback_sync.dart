/// Playback derives frames from wall-clock elapsed time (frames drop, time
/// never stretches), so a clip started at the right offset stays in sync by
/// construction. This class therefore only mirrors the controller's
/// lifecycle:
///
/// - activation → build the schedule, create ONE player per scheduled clip
///   and prepare (load) them all up front; then start every clip
///   overlapping the start frame at the exact time of `frame - clipStart`;
/// - forward ticking → start clips whose start frame was crossed, stop
///   clips past their end. A sound is TRACK-owned, so it runs to its own
///   end and across cut boundaries — dialogue and music span cuts, and a
///   cut boundary never restarts anything. Starting and stopping only
///   seeks/resumes/stops prepared players; no media pipeline is opened or
///   torn down on a tick, so boundaries never stall the frame ticker;
/// - pause / resume / stop → forwarded to every playing player;
/// - backward jumps (loop wrap, seeks) and forward jumps larger than
///   [resyncThresholdFrames] → stop everything and restart what overlaps.
///   Smaller forward jumps are indistinguishable from dropped frames, where
///   the audio kept real time on the native thread and restarting it would
///   glitch — those keep playing untouched;
/// - deactivation → stop and dispose every player.
///
/// Clip lengths come from the waveform peaks ([durationSecondsFor]); clips
/// whose peaks are not extracted yet fall back to the cut end (a shorter
/// file simply completes early, stopping a completed player is a no-op).
