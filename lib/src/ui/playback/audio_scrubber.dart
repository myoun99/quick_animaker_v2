/// This is the anime-tool scrub — TVPaint, and every NLE's JKL shuttle at
/// its slowest, do the same thing: as the playhead crosses a frame, that
/// frame's worth of sound plays. Because the mixer builds a mix rather
/// than starting clips, a scrub tick is just `play(frame, frame+1)` on
/// the same transport playback uses — one arm per crossed frame, samples
/// exact, no media pipeline opened per tick.
///
/// The schedule uploads ONCE per gesture (the first frame the scrub
/// actually crosses), from the same scheduler playback uses, over the
/// active-cut playlist — so scrubbed sound and played sound can never
/// disagree. Standing down is silent and per-gesture: no device, no
/// resident PCM, or a cut with no sound leaves the scrub visual-only,
/// exactly as it was before this class existed.
