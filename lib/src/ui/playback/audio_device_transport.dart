/// The device transport (audio program wiring): playback on the audio
/// master clock.
///
/// This is where the program's central promise is cashed. The native
/// device counts samples handed to the hardware; this class uploads the
/// mix schedule, arms the transport alongside the playback controller,
/// and answers "what frame is being heard" — which the controller shows
/// instead of its wall clock. Cumulative drift is structurally zero
/// because there is no second clock to drift against.
///
/// Standing down is graceful BY DESIGN, never silent in effect: no native
/// binary, a device that refuses to open, or PCM not resident yet (a
/// conform still building, a device-rate conversion in flight) leaves
/// [carryingPlayback] false — the platform-player fallback carries the
/// run, the wall clock drives the picture, and the missing pieces are
/// kicked so the NEXT run rides the device. Silence is never an
/// acceptable outcome for audio.
